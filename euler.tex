%% So you want a venn diagram in your proof? Awesome! I hear all the cool kids are using venn diagrams. Here's a basic template that you can modify to fit your needs.

%% In order to use tikz, you need to tell latex that you need the tikz package. If you're adding a venn diagram to an existing proof, make sure this line goes in the preamble.

% Daniel discovered how to make Venn diagrams in Tex.  Below is his advice that we can all do this.

%% You can adjust the opacity here. For venn diagrams it is convenient to have a low opacity so that you can see intersections

%% The draw command knows a lot of shapes. To make a rectangle you just need to specify two diagonal corners. Make sure you always have a semicolon at the end of your draw commands, otherwise latex flips out.
    \draw (-5,5) rectangle (5,-6);
    
%% Similarly, you can make a circle by specifying the center and then the radius. You can also add a fill color, but if you're printing in black and white you'll probably want to remove that line.
